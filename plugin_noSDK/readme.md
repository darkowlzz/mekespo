This is the plugin that i started working on when i realised that it is not a pretty process and spend more than two days just to make a websocket connection from a plugin, which overall had a lot of catches and it sitll doesnt work the right way. I just attach it to the current tab and run this. This is in a mega dirty state and might not work at all. I suggest checking out ../plugin for what works and what is really clean :D
